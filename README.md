# üíº SalaryPredict AI - Data Scientist Salary Predictor using Ml

A comprehensive tool designed to estimate data science salaries based on job descriptions. This project helps data scientists negotiate better salaries when searching for a job.

## üöÄ Project Overview
- **Goal**: Build a salary estimator for data scientists to help them assess potential salaries based on job listings.
- **Data**: Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from Glassdoor using Selenium and Python.
- **Tech Stack**: Engineered key features, optimized machine learning models, and built an API for user interaction.
- **Outcome**: Achieved a highly accurate salary prediction tool using machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Lasso Regression.

## üåê Web Scraping

We developed a web scraper to extract over 1000 job postings from Glassdoor. The scraper captured the following details for each job:

- Job Title
- Salary Estimate
- Job Description
- Rating
- Company Information (Name, Size, Location, Headquarters, Founded Date)
- Job Information (Type of Ownership, Industry, Sector, Revenue, Competitors)

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning

To ensure the data was usable for the model, several cleaning operations were performed:

- Extracted numerical values from salary estimates.
- Separated salary into employer-provided salary and hourly wages.
- Removed entries with missing salary information.
- Created columns for specific job skills (Python, R, Excel, AWS, Spark).
- Parsed company rating and location details.
- Calculated the company's age from the founding year.
- Created simplified job titles and seniority levels.
- Added a column for job description length.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this step, we analyzed distributions of various features and examined the relationships between variables. Below are some insights gained through pivot tables and visualizations:

### Salary by Job Title

### Job Opportunities by State

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Building

We transformed categorical variables into dummy variables and split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Three models were evaluated based on **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression** ‚Äì Baseline model
2. **Lasso Regression** ‚Äì Helps reduce overfitting by penalizing irrelevant features
3. **Random Forest** ‚Äì Robust against overfitting due to data sparsity

## üèÜ Model Performance

Among the models, **Random Forest** outperformed others in predicting salaries:

| Model                  | MAE (Mean Absolute Error) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Random Forest**       | **11.22**                 |
| Linear Regression       | 18.86                     |
| Ridge Regression        | 19.67                     |

## üî• Productionization

To deploy the model, a simple API was created using Flask. The API allows users to submit job descriptions and receive an estimated salary based on the input features.

```bash
# Running the Flask application locally
python app.py
```

The API takes in job details like title, skills required, location, and company size, and returns a salary prediction.
